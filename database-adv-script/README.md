## Advanced SQL Queries

ðŸ”¹ 1. INNER JOIN â€“ Bookings and Respective Users
Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings

ðŸ”¹ 2. LEFT JOIN â€“ Properties and Their Reviews (including properties with no reviews)

This lists all properties, with review data if available. Properties without reviews will show NULL in review fields.

ðŸ”¹ 3. FULL OUTER JOIN â€“ All Users and All Bookings

Retreive 
- Users who have made bookings (matched rows),

- Users who haven't made any bookings (booking fields will be NULL),

- Bookings not linked to any user (user fields will be NULL â€” which ideally shouldn't happen if the data is clean and foreign key constraints are enforced, but it's still useful for auditing or diagnosing orphaned data).
